# Product Vision

## Purpose

Whisper exists to change how creators and audiences interact.

Most social platforms reward visibility, performance, and public reaction. Whisper instead focuses on:

- Directed communication
- Privacy-first interaction
- Creator-controlled engagement
- High-signal audience input

Whisper transforms private questions into curated public knowledge through Stitching.

---

## Core Concept

Fans send private messages called Whispers.

Creators can:

- Respond privately
- React silently
- Stitch a Whisper into a public answer

Public stitched content never exposes fan identity.

---

## Problems Being Solved

### Creator Problems
- Comment sections become noisy and overwhelming
- Valuable questions are buried
- Public replies expose fans unintentionally

### Fan Problems
- Fear of asking questions publicly
- Being ignored in comment floods
- Lack of meaningful creator interaction

Whisper introduces asymmetric interaction where creators stay in control and fans remain safe.

---

## Design Principles

### Private First
Interaction begins privately. Public exposure is intentional.

### Creator Authority
Creators decide:
- Which whispers to respond to
- Which become public stitched answers

### No Public Fan Visibility
Fans never see other fans.

### Intentional Content
Stitched answers are curated knowledge, not reactive commentary.

---

## Product Pillars

### Whispers
Private prompts directed to creators.

### Stitching
Convert private signal into public value without identity exposure.

### Creator Inbox
A calm decision space for creators.

---

## Long-Term Direction

## Platform Boundaries

Whisper intentionally avoids:

- Public comment threads
- Popularity metrics
- Debate-style conversations
- Viral engagement loops

---

## Experience Philosophy

The UI should feel:

- Calm
- Intentional
- Private
- Focused

Not addictive.

---

## Success Signals

Measured by:

- Repeat whispers
- Creator stitch rate
- Meaningful creator retention

Not by:
- Time spent scrolling
- Number of comments
